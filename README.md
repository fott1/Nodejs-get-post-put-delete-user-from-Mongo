#A node js simple app with some basic features 

Uses routing, connection with Mongo, get, post, put and delete. 

- Facebook Login 
- Routing
- Post and Get Users
- Edit Users
- Delete user giving its ID
- Show User using providing ID at URL

The searching part takes place filtering the added users with their ID

The code is based on the tutorial of https://codeforgeek.com/2015/08/restful-api-node-mongodb/

I also implement the following https://github.com/passport/express-4.x-facebook-example,
for the Facebook Login Feature

It includes original comments and some more in Greek :P
